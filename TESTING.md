# manual testing for Coscalendar frontend

# Accessibility testing using WAVE plugin:

* Resolved issue/s:
  - No H1 on page (changed H2 on landing page to H1)
  - Very low contrast on social links (improved contrast by making them lighter compared to the footer background)
  - "Orphaned form label" on my User Profile, added id to input fields to match the htmlFor of the labels
  - Underline on Month text on the Calendar (universally recognised as a link so avoiding that)
  - No H1 on CosPlanForm, snuck in a quick H1


* Unresolved issue/s:
  - Issues with <noscript> tag being used as I wasn't certain of a good solution for this

ESLint: 

The ESlint plugin was used to ensure the JSX code was compliant and working.

HTML validator:

The HTML checker doesn't approve of self closing tags but it is an Info rather than a warning. Otherwise the results were good:

CSS validator:

Each page on the website was run through the CSS validator Jigsaw and came back clean!

# Lighthouse reports

Due to the way Lighthouse clears data before running, the reports were generated but Lighthouse threw errors because it couldn't render the page after wiping the id from the expense.
