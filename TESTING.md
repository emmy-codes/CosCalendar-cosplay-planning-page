# manual testing for Coscalendar frontend

# Accessibility testing using WAVE plugin:

* Resolved issue/s:
  - No H1 on page (changed H2 on landing page to H1)
  - Very low contrast on social links (improved contrast by making them lighter compared to the footer background)
  - "Orphaned form label" on my User Profile, added id to input fields to match the htmlFor of the labels
  - Underline on Month text on the Calendar (universally recognised as a link so avoiding that)
  - No H1 on CosPlanForm, snuck in a quick H1


* Unresolved issue/s:
  - Issues with <noscript> tag being used as I wasn't certain of a good solution for this
